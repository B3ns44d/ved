# Vid
## Open-source editor written in V with the performance of Sublime Text

Open source release on August 7. 

### This is pre-alpha software.

I've been using Vid as my main editor since June 2017 (it was re-writtein in V in June 2018). I've set it up to my liking, I know its limitations and how to bypass them. 

For everyone else it's going to be unstable and unconfigurable at this stage.

This will be gradually fixed. The goal is to have a stable and highly customizable editor. 

### Main features

- Small size (~ 1 MB binary, zero dependencies)
- Hardware accelerated text rendering
- High performance (scrolling through 300k lines with syntax highlighting without any lag)
- Vim mode
- Easy integration with any compiler/build system
- Go to definition, ctrlp (fuzzy file finder)
- Very fast search in all project files
- Integration with git
- Built-in time management system (based on Pomodoro)
- Global shortcuts (bring to front etc)
- Split view
- Workspaces
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Known issues
- No way to change key bindings, color settings, etc
- Vim-mode only

Most of these are relatively easy to fix.
